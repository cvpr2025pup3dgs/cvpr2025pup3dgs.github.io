# Differential Gaussian Rasterization with PUP Fisher Computation

A CUDA implementation of the Fisher computation for the paper "PUP 3D-GS: Principled Uncertainty Pruning for 3D Gaussian Splatting". This code is built on top of the rasterizer engine of [3D-GS](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/diff-gaussian-rasterization) and makes use of code provided by [FisherRF](https://github.com/JiangWenPL/FisherRF).
If you use this code in your research, please consider citing all three works.
